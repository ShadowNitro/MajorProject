# MajorProject
The project presented to you is a comparison of LSTM and CNN in the context of mental health conditions. Here we are trying to classify different user-generated text by means of sentiment analysis. The two approaches of CNN and LSTM are quite different in terms of architecture and brilliant in their own ways. Time dependencies in sequential data are accurately and effectively represented by LSTM; on the other hand, CNNs recognize the local characteristics within text by the application of convolutional layers. These model workouts are rated based on the dataset of text related to mental health to catch up with anxiety, depression, and other issues. Use of CNN for textual based analysis is exciting in itself as its traditional or common use case is in computer vision. The application of deep learning tools in mental health programs will be greatly improved with continuous experiments and findings like these as they become guidelines for the development of accurate as well as scalable systems.
